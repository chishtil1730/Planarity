## Planarity - CSS Debugger Tool

## Cross-Framework Z-Index Intelligence & Visualization

---

## 1. Problem To Solve

In modern web applications, `z-index` often becomes a silent source of complexity :

* Arbitrary values like `z-index: 9999`
* Implicit stacking contexts created by `position`, `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`, etc.
* Framework abstractions (React, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS) hiding actual browser behavior
* Debugging that relies on trial-and-error rather than system understanding

Existing browser DevTools expose *computed styles*, but they lack:

* A global stacking overview
* Source-level traceability and reliability 
* Safe refactoring workflows
* Change history, intent with ease and precision

## 3D Pan Visualization

The 3D pan view represents the browser’s stacking model in spatial form.

- The **X-axis** represents stacking depth (z-index type)
- Each **stacking context** is rendered as a separate plane
- Elements within a context appear as nodes positioned relative to their parent
- Panning along the X-axis reveals overlap and render order visually
- Complete 3d view of how each layer is aligned

Interactions:
- Hovering an element highlights it in the live page
- Clicking focuses its stacking context and source mapping
- Context boundaries make implicit stacking rules explicit

This visualization explains *why* elements overlap the way they do, not just *that* they overlap.

## 🚀 Advanced Spatial Features

### 💻 CLI-Injected HUD (The "Sidecar")
* **Dev Bubble**: Launched via `planarity`, the tool lives as a floating, expandable bubble over your live application.
* **Bi-Directional Sync**: Uses WebSockets to connect the browser HUD to your IDE; dragging a layer in 3D updates your source code (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, or CSS) in real-time.
* **Git-Style Staging**: Review "Spatial Diffs" in a staging area before committing z-index changes to your codebase.

### 🧊 Dual-Mode Visualization
* **2D Isometric Mode**: Uses CSS3 transforms to render the page as a stack of "tilted cards" for quick logical debugging.
* **3D WebGL Mode**: A full-scale Three.js environment that "explodes" the DOM into a Cartesian space, perfect for deep architectural audits. Allows users to navigate through the issue easily if it is something that's easily visible when imagined



### 🛠 CLI Reference
| Command | Action |
|:---|:---|
| \`planarity\` | Starts the dev-server and injects the HUD bubble. |
| \`planarity audit\` | Scans for "z-index smells" like arbitrary 9999s and broken contexts. |
| \`planarity stage\` | Displays a diff of pending spatial changes. |
| \`planarity push\` | Hard-writes staged changes back to the source files. |

## 2. Core Idea

**Z-Lens treats z-index as a system, not a single CSS property.**

It combines:

1. Runtime inspection of stacking contexts (browser)
2. Static analysis of the codebase (source)
3. Git-style staging and committing of z-index changes

The goal is to make layering behavior **visible, explainable, and controllable** across frameworks.

---

## 3. Design Principles

* **Browser behavior is the source of truth**
* Frameworks are treated as *input formats*, not core logic
* Runtime data and source data must be linkable but independent
* Changes should be intentional, reviewable, and reversible

---

## 4. High-Level Architecture

Z-Lens is composed of four cooperating layers:

1. **Runtime Inspector (Browser)**
   Observes computed CSS and DOM stacking behavior

2. **Visualization Layer**
   Presents stacking contexts and elements in a 3D spatial model

3. **Source Mapping Engine**
   Maps runtime elements back to framework-specific source locations

4. **Patch & Staging Engine**
   Applies controlled changes to the codebase with diffs and commits

---

## 5. Runtime Layer (Language-Agnostic)

This layer runs inside the browser (extension / devtools panel) and does **not** depend on how the code was written.

### Responsibilities

* Walk the DOM tree
* Read computed styles using `getComputedStyle`
* Detect stacking context creators:

  * `position` + non-auto `z-index`
  * `transform`
  * `opacity < 1`
  * `filter`
  * `isolation: isolate`
* Build a **stacking context graph**

This graph represents *actual rendering order*, not declared order.

---

## 6. Visualization Layer (3D Layer View)

The visualization presents stacking contexts in a spatial model:

* X-axis represents depth / stacking order
* Each stacking context is a plane
* Elements are rendered as nodes/cards within planes
* Hover highlights the element in the page
* Click focuses the source mapping

This answers questions like:

* Why is this element above another?
* Which stacking context controls this element?
* Why does changing z-index have no effect?

---

## 7. Source Mapping Engine (Framework-Aware)

Z-Lens uses **pluggable resolvers** to map runtime elements back to source code.

### Resolver Responsibilities

* Identify how a z-index was defined
* Locate its source file and position
* Provide a safe edit strategy

### Supported Sources (Extensible)

* Plain CSS / HTML
* React / JSX / TSX
* Tailwind CSS utilities and config
* CSS-in-JS (styled-components, emotion)
* Inline styles

If mapping fails, runtime data remains usable.

---

## 8. Editing Model

Z-Lens does not directly mutate files.

Instead, it:

* Generates patches
* Shows diffs (before/after)
* Allows selective staging of changes
* Applies changes only on user confirmation

Each table row knows *how* it can be safely edited based on its resolver.

---

## 9. Git-Style Workflow

Changes flow through stages:

1. Inspect runtime stacking
2. Propose z-index adjustments
3. Stage selected changes
4. Review diffs
5. Commit or discard

This prevents accidental layout regressions and encourages intentional layering design.

---

## 10. Why This Scales

* Framework-agnostic core
* Plugin-based source resolvers
* Browser-defined behavior guarantees correctness
* Encourages design-system-level thinking for layers

Z-Lens turns a historically ad-hoc CSS problem into a **structured, debuggable system**.

---

## 11. Future Extensions

* Named layer contracts (e.g. `modal > overlay > tooltip`)
* Z-index budgets and constraints
* Team-wide layering conventions
* CI warnings for stacking violations
* Shadow DOM and Web Components support
